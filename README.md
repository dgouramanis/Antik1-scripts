# Antik1-scripts
Reference bash scripts for canned operations with beagleg

I'm sharing these scripts for example/reference. They were written for my custom CNC milling machine (named Antik1), and are hardware-specific. 

The scripts collect information from the user via command line, and output/execute G code using BeagleG. The result is a "conversational CNC" machine.
